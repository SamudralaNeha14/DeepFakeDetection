# DeepFakeDetection

- Our project addresses the critical issue of detecting deepfake content, which threatens societal integrity, by leveraging the advanced capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
- By scrutinizing deepfake generation techniques and employing diverse datasets for model training and evaluation, we enhance the accuracy and robustness of deepfake detection, mitigating risks to politics, journalism, and personal privacy.
- This research not only resolves current detection challenges but also paves the way for future advancements in safeguarding digital media, contributing valuable insights to inform and guide ongoing efforts in this vital field.
